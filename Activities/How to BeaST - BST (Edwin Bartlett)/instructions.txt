Sample Output 1

--- Initializing and Inserting String Data into BST ---
Inserted key: "Mango"
Inserted key: "Apple"
Inserted key: "Pineapple"
Inserted key: "Banana"
Inserted key: "Grape"
Inserted key: "Orange"
Inserted key: "Kiwi"
Key "Mango" already exists. Ignoring.


--- BST Traversal Results ---
1. In-Order Traversal (Left-Root-Right, Sorted):
   "Apple" "Banana" "Grape" "Kiwi" "Mango" "Orange" "Pineapple"

2. Pre-Order Traversal (Root-Left-Right):
   "Mango" "Apple" "Banana" "Grape" "Kiwi" "Pineapple" "Orange"

3. Post-Order Traversal (Left-Right-Root):
   "Kiwi" "Grape" "Banana" "Apple" "Orange" "Pineapple" "Mango"

Tree destroyed and memory freed.
