Edwin Bartlett - Open Hashing

Problem Statement

Create a C program that inserts, deletes, and searches the RGB value in an open hashing dictionary using array of linked list implementation.

All you have to do is write the following functions inside dict.c. The main function and struct definitions are already provided.

hashFunction() - A weighted sum of the R, G, and B components is calculated, and the result is constrained by the PALETTE_SIZE.
createDictionary() - Initializes the hash table by setting all 64 bucket pointers to NULL.
createNode(Color) - Allocates memory for a new Node and initializes it with the provided Color data.
insertColor() - Calculates the hash index and inserts the new Color's node at the head of the corresponding linked list (chaining).
searchColor() - Calculates the hash index, then traverses the linked list at that index. It performs a full RGB value comparison to find the correct entry among potential collisions.
Tips
hashFunction(int rgb[3])

Use the following prime numbers to minimize collisions:
R is multiplied by 3.
G is multiplied by 5.
B is multiplied by 7.
Apply modulo (%) with the size of the hash table.
 
createDictionary(Dictionary *dict)

Iterate through the entire buckets array from index 0 up to PALETTE_SIZE - 1 and set the value of each element to NULL.
 
createNode(Color newColor)

Basically allocating memory for a new node and setting the data.
Don't forget to use strcpy for the colorName.
 
insertColor(Dictionary *dict, Color newColor)

Calculate the index using the hashFunction, create the new node using createNode, and then insert it at the head of the list.
 
searchColor(Dictionary *dict, int rgb[3])

Calculate the index using the hashFunction, then traverse through each node of the list and check if all three values (R, G, and B) match.

Sample Output 1:
--- Inserting Colors ---
-> Inserted 'Red' (RGB: 255, 0, 0) into bucket [61].
-> Inserted 'Green' (RGB: 0, 255, 0) into bucket [59].
-> Inserted 'Blue' (RGB: 0, 0, 255) into bucket [57].
-> Inserted 'White' (RGB: 255, 255, 255) into bucket [49].
-> Inserted 'Black' (RGB: 0, 0, 0) into bucket [0].
-> Inserted 'Dark Grey' (RGB: 10, 10, 10) into bucket [22].
-> Inserted 'Dark Red' (RGB: 30, 0, 0) into bucket [26].

--- Inserting Colliding Colors ---
-> Inserted 'Light Grey' (RGB: 1, 1, 1) into bucket [15].
-> Inserted 'Slightly Red' (RGB: 5, 0, 0) into bucket [15].

--- Color Dictionary Content ---
Bucket [0]: Black (0,0,0)
Bucket [15]: Slightly Red (5,0,0) -> Light Grey (1,1,1)
Bucket [22]: Dark Grey (10,10,10)
Bucket [26]: Dark Red (30,0,0)
Bucket [49]: White (255,255,255)
Bucket [57]: Blue (0,0,255)
Bucket [59]: Green (0,255,0)
Bucket [61]: Red (255,0,0)
